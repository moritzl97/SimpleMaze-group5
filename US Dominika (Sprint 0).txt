US Dominika (Sprint 0) 

Type of room: Computer Lab 
Type of puzzles: Pattern recognition and Riddle 
Layout of the room: computers, drawer, a whiteboard, laptop connected to a big projector 
  
As a player:
-I want to look around the Computer Lab so that I can understand the room layout and search for a needed item to a puzzle
-I want to be able to interact with at least one npc so that I can get more information and hints
-I want to solve puzzles based on ICT's seminars (Intercultural collaboration, Database Application, Professional Skills and Python Programing) so that I can apply what I’ve learned in a fun, interactive way
-I want to save my progress so that I can return to the lab later without losing what I’ve solved
-I want to solve a riddle given by an NPC so that I can gain a password to the laptop 

AC: 
-When the final puzzle is completed the game should reward the player by giving them an item 
-Each ICT seminar is represented by at least one puzzle 
-An incorrect answer triggers a fail sequence that forces the player to re-try the puzzles again 
-Items can be picked up, examined and stored in inventory 
-Player can’t interact with irrelevant objects (only story-functional items respond)
