US Moritz:
Dragon room. The room should be filled with a small number of different non-playable characters (NPCs) and interactable objects. The Player should be able to talk to the different NPCs. The dialog system should be branching, so that the player is able to make different choices with different outcomes. The success of the actions the player takes is probability based, including the success of the dialog options they choose. The success rate of the outcome is boosted by different items that the player can find in the room and certain dialog choices.
The game should be able to handle item transfers between the player and the NPCs, as rewards or to achieve certain changes in the room.  There should be a shopkeeper NPC who can trade items with the player. 
The room is fantasy themed. There is a hole in the ground with a dragon hoard. The goal of the player is to deal with the dragon to get an item that is required to beat the game. The player has to collect multiple items in the correct order and has to succeed in multiple tasks to finish the room. There should be different ways such as a diplomatic option, the option to best the dragon in a battle or brute forcing the room, by trying low probability options multiple times in a row.
As a punishment for failing a task the player could be kicked out of the room and cannot enter for a while. Alternatively, the player is stuck and forced to wait a specific number of seconds. 
All interactions are text based by writing commands in the terminal.
Players who decide to play the game multiple times can engage in finding the fastest way to complete the room with the knowledge they gather each time they play.
The player has to choose which item to collect, which choices to make and which chances to take.
