Tieme van Rees room story (CyberRoom)

You enter a glowing data chamber. 
In front of you, a terminal blocks the exit, its screen flashing:“Access denied, security code required”. 
The walls are tall screens filled with cascading green code, but most of it is glitching, stuttering, and breaking apart. 
Next to it, three panels flicker with mathematical clues. 
Each panel represents one digit of the 3-digit escape code. 
Each panel contains a scratched of number with a math equation above it. 
The player must solve every equation to get a number for the security code. 
The three computer panels are not in a specific order that is the same as the security code. 
So you must try all the sequences with the numbers you obtained. 
Once you have the right security code the middle computer panel opens so you can take the key for the next room. 

Acceptance criteria

-Locked terminal requires a 3-digit code.
-Player is shown three complex math problems.
-Wrong answer -> “Access denied” (retry).
-Correct answer (…) -> terminal shows “Access granted” and the panel opens up with the key for the next room.
