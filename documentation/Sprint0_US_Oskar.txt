Entering the Room
You approach Classroom 1.07. The door is locked, and a small note is taped to it: “Hall Pass Required.”
If you don’t have the hall pass, you are sent back into the corridor.
If you do have it, the door clicks open and you step inside.
Looking Around
Inside, the air smells of chemicals. Beakers and test tubes bubble quietly on the counters.
On the teacher’s desk sits a locked glass case containing something shiny — it looks like a magnet.
On the chalkboard is written in large letters: “Only those who think clearly may proceed.”
The Challenge
The science teacher in a white lab coat steps forward and asks:
“I am taken from a mine, locked in a wooden case, never released, yet almost everyone uses me. What am I?”
Outcome if Correct
If you answer “pencil”, the teacher smiles and unlocks the glass case.
Inside is the shiny magnet, now available for you to take.
Outcome if Incorrect
If you give the wrong answer, the teacher shakes his head.
He points to the door, and you are sent back into the corridor empty-handed.
Item to Collect
The magnet (inside the glass case).
Once collected, you can carry it in your inventory for future puzzles.
Visiting Again
If you return after solving the riddle:
The teacher nods, acknowledging you’ve already succeeded.
If you haven’t taken the magnet yet, it’s still waiting in the glass case.
If you already took it, the case is empty.
Exits
The only exit leads back into the corridor.
